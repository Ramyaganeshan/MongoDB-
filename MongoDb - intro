SQL vs Document Databases:
SQL databases are considered relational databases. They store related data in separate tables. 
When data is needed, it is queried from multiple tables to join the data back together.

MongoDB is a document database which is often referred to as a non-relational database.
This does not mean that relational data cannot be stored in document databases. 
It means that relational data is stored differently. A better way to refer to it 
is as a non-tabular database.

MongoDB stores data in flexible documents. Instead of having multiple tables you can 
simply keep all of your related data together. This makes reading your data very fast.

You can still have multiple groups of data too. In MongoDB,
instead of tables these are called collections.



Local vs Cloud Database:
MongoDB can be installed locally, which will allow you to host your own MongoDB 
server on your hardware. This requires you to manage your server,
upgrades, and any other maintenance.

You can download and use the MongoDB open source Community Server
on your hardware for free.

However, for this course we are going to use MongoDB Atlas,
a cloud database platform. This is much easier than hosting your own local database.

To be able to experiment with the code examples, you will need access to a MongoDB database.
